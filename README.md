# Tech Writing docs

A repository with source files for generating a static page from Markdown using MkDocs and a custom theme.

To raise a local server with documentation, install MkDocs and [follow the instructions from the generator website](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started /). 

How to install the environment, go to the project folder and type `mk docs build` in the terminal. This will create site files that can be put on the server. 

Result: http://mishuks.ru/
